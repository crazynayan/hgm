# Hearthstone Grandmaster 2021 Tournament Selector

This is a customized application for my son!! 
He wants a Hearthstone Grandmaster 2021 style tournament in which 48 players compete against each other 
across 3 regions (APAC, Europe, Americas) in which a winner for each region is identified. It is an eight week 
tournament in which first seven weeks will be the qualifiers, and the final week will be the playoff.

The actual hearthstone game and series is NOT played here. The user has just to select the winner based on his choice.

# Note
The application is under development. Connect with [us](mailto:info@crazyideas.co.in?subject=Contribute) if you want
